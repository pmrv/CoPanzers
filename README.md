# CoPanzers - Script Dem Panzers
Attempt at a (programmable) shoot'em up game based on an entity-component-system,
requires Python3, [PySDL2][] and [ecs][].

## Running
Grab [PySDL2][] and [ecs][] from PyPI (`pip
install ecs PySDL2`).

Then `./bin/tanks demo` should create a window with a bit of stuff going on.
There will be two turret shooting at things and a tank driving around doing
nothing in particular. You may have to squint a bit to recognize them as I may have
been a bit laz… abstract when designing the textures.

So the twist is that this behaviour is not hardcoded into the demo but
controlled by (more or less) simple python coroutines. They are found in
[presets/ai/](presets/ai/), feel free to play around with them once I
have explained how they work.

You can also have a number routines battle each other with `./bin/tanks match
path/script1.py path/script2.py …`.

## Scripts
I'll just assume you know about python's function generators for now. The cool
thing about generators is that they allow us to start/stop execution at almost
arbitrary points in functions.

The only constraints on you script files are:

1. they contain valid python (this is why you want to watch whose scripts you
   run, nothing stops a script from running `shutil.rmtree ("~")`)

2. they have a generator function called `main` which takes two arguments
   (which I'll explain later)

3. they yield functions taking no arguments which return either `True` or
   `False`

The general process followed by the game is this:

1. it calls `main` with an object representing the tank your script controls
   and an object that has some info about the battlefield (for now the total
   elapsed time and its size, aptly named `.time` and `.size`, thereby instantiating
   the generator

2. each tick of the game the function last yielded by your generator is
   executed (`lambda: True` in the first tick), if it returns `True` execution in
   your generator is resumed, if not the game will just retry in the next tick

3. your generator runs until you yield the next function, during that period
   the game does *nothing* else, i.e. *between* `yields` everything is static,
   but also that malicious scripts can halt the whole game

4. goto 2.

So with that in mind let's look over
[presets/ai/demo_tank.py](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L19) to get some of the details
straight.

* Line [19-21](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L19):

    As I said previously the first argument is an interface to your tank. This
    is a reference so the exact value of e.g. `tank.position` *will* change
    over time, but *only* when your generator is currently not executing.

* Line [23-25](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L23)

    It's getting a little bit more interesting now. We're setting the tank to
    full speed and rotate by -90°, i.e. to the top. After that we yield a
    function that will return `False` until the tank moved up so the y
    coordinate of its position is smaller 50. Keep in mind that for some stupid
    reason the origin is in the top left corner in computer graphics.
    This is the important step, until now our generator ran undisturbed and the
    value of `tank.position` didn't change (since it was the only thing
    running), now that we yielded the function the rest of the game will
    continue to run and 'wake' us when the condition encoded in the function is
    true.

* Line [27-38](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L27):

    Now those are some minor variations of the former theme, just to drive the
    point home.

* Line [40](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L40):

    Just something to ease debugging of your scripts, check
    [this](copanzers/scripts.py#L17) if you're familiar with python `logging`
    module.

* Line [43](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L43):

    This is just to show you that you can still encapsulate behaviour like you can
    with functions, just that you use sub generators and the `yield from` syntax
    now. `game.time` as mentioned earlier is just a float telling you how much
    time has passed.

* Line [49](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L49):

    So there is stuff mounted on you tank. Some more on that in the next
    example and next section. For now it's first its weapon and
    then its radar. You can always check it with `[print (m ["Class"]) for m in
    tank.mounts]`, though. Check next section with details on both.

* Line [52](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L52):

    This will iterate over all entities visible on your radar, but there's a
    catch. The loop will only go over entities that were visible at the time
    the loop started. If you yield in the loop, as we do here, this might not
    be everything there is to see. I don't have an easy fix for this though, so
    meh™.

* Line [53-54](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L53):

    Positions are vectors, so you can add and subtract them and some more, check the next
    section for some details.

* Line [54](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L54):

    Interfaces of all types are comparable to each other will compare equal if
    they refer to the same entity, we use this here to not target ourselves.

* Line [56](presets/ai/demo_tank.py#L56)

    It's getting a bit complicated here to show that the function we return
    don't have to be without side effects, but are actually a pretty good place
    to do some periodic stuff as it is called every tick of the game. Note that
    you don't have to use partial function application to pull this off, you can
    also use closures and nested function definitions to achieve the same, I
    just don't like it as much.

You will notice that the tank also has a weapon and we will see in
[presets/ai/demo_turret.py](presets/ai/demo_turret.py#L10) how to use it. I will also
explain a bit more about the second argument the generator function is call with.

* Line [12](presets/ai/demo_turret.py#L12):

    So this is where weapons come in. Your tank has a attribute `.mounts` which
    is a list of all stuff mounted on top of it (only one weapon so far, but
    that may change in the future). The weapon has a very similar interface to
    the one of your tank, but obviously some attributes will be different or
    not existent, check the next section for details.

* Line [14](presets/ai/demo_turret.py#L14):

    This is line has two important points:
    1. the attribute `turret.visible` is an iterator over all living entities
       (including the your tank) that within eyeshot of your tank represented
       by similar interfaces as your
       tank or your weapon, but in a read-only fashion
    2. the interfaces (except `RadarInterface`, see next section)
       act like dictionary storing some meta data about the
       entity in question, e.g. the "Class" key lets you distinguish between
       barriers, tanks, turret or bullets; if an entity is not tagged with a
       certain key it will raise a `KeyError` just like an ordinary dictionary,
       there will be docs on the keys employed by the game later™

* Line [5](presets/ai/demo_turret.py#L5):

    Every interface we talked about so far also has a attribute `.destroyed`
    which is exactly what it says on the tin. If an entity is destroyed all
    attempts to access attributes on its interface will result in
    `AttributeError`.

There is also a slightly more sophisticated example, which you can check out
with `./bin/tanks match presets/ai{circles.py,defender.py}`.

## Interfaces
Interfaces and their attributes give your script a way to interface neatly with
entities and their components.

There are three different types of interfaces so far and each exhibits a couple
of attributes depending on which components the entity behind the interface
sports, `RadarInterface`, `ROInterface` and `RWInterface`. The latter being
supersets of the respective former. `RWInterface` is what you have for the
tank your script is controlling, everything you get from its `.visible`
attribute is wrapped in `ROInterface` and everything coming from your radars
`.visible` is `RadarInterface`.

So what are components? Basically data about a entity, e.g. `Position` is a
component and describes that an entity is positioned at a certain point.
At the end of this section I'll give you a list
which thing we encountered so far (tanks, weapons, radars) has which
components, but first have list of all attributes, what type of interface they
first appear on and what components are needed for them.

If you try to access an attribute on an interface and the entity lacks the
needed component an `AttributeError` will be raised.  Interfaces refering to
the same entity are the same, there is only one instance of a given interface
type for a given entity.  From `ROInterface` on interfaces can be indexed
(read-only) like dictionaries for some meta data (docs pending).

 Attribute name | First on Interface | Component needed | Description
:--------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:
 `.destroyed`   | `RadarInterface`   |                  | `False` if the entity is alive, if this is `True` the entity is not in the game anymore and all components have been removed from it.
 `.position`    | `RadarInterface`   | `Position`       | This is a vector, you can treat it like a 2-tuple or use the `.x`, `.y`, `.angle` and `length` attributes, it also supports adding it to other vectors and scalar multiplication, but lacks full docs sofar, check the [source](copanzers/util.py#66) for now.
 `.hp`          | `ROInterface`      | `Health`         | Current hit points of the entity.
 `.max_hp`      | `ROInterface`      | `Health`         | Maximum hit points of the entity.
 `.size`        | `ROInterface`      | `Hitbox`         | Size of the hit box of the entity, 2 tuple.
 `.rotation`    | `ROInterface`      | `Movement`       | Rotation of the entity, in radians, rotation 0 is parallel to the x-axis.
 `.mounts`      | `ROInterface`      | `Mount`          | List of either `ROInterface` of mounted entities or None if the respective mount point is empty.
 `.root`        | `ROInterface`      | `Mountable`      | The entity this entity is mounted on, e.g. your tank on the interface of its weapon.
 `.mounts`      | `RWInterface`      | `Mount`          | List of either `RWInterface` of mounted entities or None if the respective mount point is empty. Tricky, huh.
 `.rotation`    | `RWInterface`      | `Movement`       | Same as on `ROInterface` but you can set it now.
 `.speed`       | `RWInterface`      | `Movement`       | Speed of the entity as a scalar, in px/s.
 `.max_speed`   | `RWInterface`      | `Movement`       | Maximum speed of an entity as a scalar, in px/s
 `.velocity`    | `RWInterface`      | `Movement`       | Velocity of the entity as a vector (same kind as `.position`), in px/s.
 `.throttle`    | `RWInterface`      | `Movement`       | Speed of the entity in percent, setter clamps the value between 0 and 1.
 `.shoot`       | `RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Attention, this one's a method no attribute. Calling this will shoot a bullet, if the weapon is reloaded. The bullet will fly in the direction of the `.rotation` attribute of the weapon.
 `.till_reloaded`|`RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Seconds until this weapon can fire again.
 `.reload_time` | `RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Minimum time between shots, in seconds.
 `.bullet_damage`|`RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Damage done by this weapon's bullets of this weapon.
 `.bullet_speed`| `RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Speed of this weapon's bullets, in px/s.
 `.bullet_hp`   | `RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Hit points of this weapon's bullets.
 `.bullet_size` | `RWInterface`      | `Weapon`         | Similar to `.size` but for this weapon's bullets.
 `.visible`     | `RWInterface`      | `Vision`         | Iterator over all living entities that are visible to this entity. The type of interface they're wrapped depends on `.vision`. For "radar" it's `RadarInterface`, for "plain" `ROInterface`.
 `.vision`      | `RWInterface`      | `Vision`         | What kind of vision this entity has, currently either "plain" or "radar".
 `.visualrange` | `RWInterface`      | `Vision`         | How far this entity can see, in px.


I don't like half of the attribute names in here, so shoot me ideas if you have
them.
